# Generative-Adversarial-Networks-and-Transfer-Learning
Deep neural networks are used mainly for supervised learning: classification or regression. Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs, however, use neural networks for a very different purpose: Generative modeling  Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering 

There are two neural networks: a Generator and a Discriminator. The generator generates a "fake" sample given a random vector/matrix, and the discriminator attempts to detect whether a given sample is "real" (picked from the training data) or "fake" (generated by the generator). Training happens in tandem: we train the discriminator for a few epochs, then train the generator for a few epochs, and repeat. This way both the generator and the discriminator get better at doing their jobs.

GANs however, can be notoriously difficult to train, and are extremely sensitive to hyperparameters, activation functions and regularization. In this tutorial, we'll train a GAN to generate images of anime characters' faces.![6NMdO9u](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25ef1551-5cd4-4e10-b383-1ae2fbb6f250)

Discriminator Training
Since the discriminator is a binary classification model, we can use the binary cross entropy loss function to quantify how well it is able to differentiate between real and generated images.
